# newBoard Project

**What is it?**

- The *board* for the Go game on C++;

- Made originally *for terminal*;

- May include some *plug-ins support*;

**The main idea!**

I want this to be the open-source project, as i don't want nothing from it, its just about learning the algorithms and some C++ tricks, also writing better code (meant style and organized). So be free to add or edit something, it'll be a great!

Possible to-do's:

- [x]  Make a classes for the commands

- [ ]  Make vim-like environment for terminal

- [ ]  Make a working territory counter

- [ ]  Make a moving-order system (with trees support)

- [ ]
